        A real-time generative graphics tribute to <em>Spirited Away</em>

      <h2>Celebrating one of the greatest animated movies ever made.</h2>

        This is the first NFT Artifact commissioned by Artizen as we reopen our grants using what web3 has to offer.
        With this artwork, Eddie Lee wanted to pay homage to Miyazaki’s movies. He decided by far the most iconic image
        was No Face. Based on his signed-distance field (SDF) sketches, he created a vibing and floating character with
        black iridescent “goop” flowing through his body for a really visceral image, enhanced by Norman Bambi’s dreamy
        score.

  'Meet the Artist': (

      <h1>Graphic artist, VR engineer, and game developer</h1>
      <h2>
        Eddie Lee is the founder of indie game studio Funktronic Labs and one of the most-collected NFT artists on
        Tezos.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Eddie started out in games and immersive VR projects, fascinated by the possibilities of connecting mathematics,
        code, and art. And he recently moved into the crypto and NFT space, curious to try out new avenues of
        expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his work, he likes pushing boundaries and mixing genres, but in a way that feels natural. Always ahead of the
        curve when it comes to digital art trends, he’s taken to creating dynamic NFTs to fully explore the potential of
        smart contract platforms. He’s really into art pieces that can change and evolve based on the viewer’s actions
        and decisions. For some more samples of his work, [https://eddietree.xyz](go to eddietree.xyz).

        All the money we raise is pooled and awarded to creators, and donors can win the Artifact.

        <em>Miyazaki’s No Face</em> is our inaugural Artifact, and you can become the owner of one of its four editions
