    question: 'How does the Artizen Prize work?',
    answer: `
Artizen awards cash prizes to creators who make an impact in the world through art, science, technology, and design. Submissions are reviewed and curated by the Artizen community. Projects in the Official Selection sell cultural Artifacts in the form of NFTs to raise funds and climb our leaderboard. At the end of each season, the project with the most Artifacts sold wins the prestigious Artizen Prize, receiving financial support and recognition.

    question: 'What are Artifacts?',
    answer: `
Artifacts are a new type of NFT designed to help creators raise money for their projects. Minted on Ethereum as an open edition ERC-1155, each Artifact represents a unique work of art that captures the spark of inspiration behind a project and its intended impact on the world. Only projects that make it into the Official Selection are allowed to create and sell Artifacts. Artifacts also serve as a membership pass to Artizen, empowering owners to curate projects, join a vibrant community of creators, and invest in positive impact.

    question: 'How are projects curated for the Official Selection?',
    answer: `
Projects are curated for the Official Selection through a community-driven process where Artifact owners review and evaluate submissions based on Artizen's curatorial guidelines: originality, impact, and feasibility. Each Artifact equals one vote, granting more voting power to those with more Artifacts. The strongest projects, as determined by community voting and adherence to the guidelines, form the Official Selection, where they create and sell Artifacts to raise funds and compete for the Artizen Prize.

    question: 'How much funding do projects receive?',
    answer: `
Projects in the Official Selection raise funds by selling Artifacts, which they keep for their project's development. Additionally, the top three projects at the end of the season receive a split of the Prize funds: 1st place gets 70%, 2nd place gets 20%, and 3rd place gets 10%. This combination of Artifact sales and Prize funds provides substantial financial support to creators for their innovative projects.

    question: 'Where does the money come from for the cash prizes?',
    answer: `
The money for the cash prizes primarily comes from two sources. First, a portion of the funds raised through the sale of Artifacts contributes to the Prize funds, with 20% of each Artifact sold going toward the cash prizes. Second, generous donors can contribute to the Prize funds by sending ETH directly to ArtizenFund.eth. These combined sources of funding ensure a substantial prize pool that grows throughout the season, providing increased support for the top three projects each season.
