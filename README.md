## Environment variables

- Create a `.env` file in the root of the project, check `.env.test` for the required variables

We recommend using 1Password to manage your secrets. File: `.env_1password_template.txt` is a template to use with 1Password.

## Database

Metadata is mainly saved in Hasura. You can find the schema in `hasura/schema.graphql`. You can also find the schema in the Hasura console.

Web3 data is saved in the stage memory of Season smart contract. Find more information in the their [Season Contract Repository](https://github.com/artizen-fund/seasons-contracts)






## Installation

- requires Node 16.14.2+

## Getting Started

### Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Graphql codegen:

```bash
yarn codegen
```

### Create a new component:

```bash
yarn generate
```

### Run Cypress tests:

- make sure sure dev server is running, then‚Ä¶

```bash
yarn test
```

### Run Jest tests:

```bash
yarn test:jest
```

### Run Playwright end-to-end tests

The following will start a local dev server and run playwright e2e tests against it:

```bash
yarn test:e2e:local
```

Note: playwright e2e tests will run automatically when you perform a `git push` command (via a pre-push
git hook managed by husky). This is a good way to help ensure code quality but there are situations
when you may want to bypass this check. Please use good judgement when providing the `--no-verify` flag
to `git push` in these situations, i.e. use the following responsibly when pushing:

```bash
git push --no-verify
```

### Metamask setup

- Install and setup [Metamask](https://metamask.io/download/) in your browser
  - [Help and Frequently Asked Questions](https://metamask.io/faqs)
- Add Goerli network to your Metamask
  - ChainID: 80001
  - Block Explorer: https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/


### Get Goerli ETH

- Get some Goerli ETH from [faucet](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/) to your Metamask wallet
